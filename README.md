Todos Api
Introduction
Requirements
Api for complete CRUD on Todo Models
Start your api Project
run the following commands:

mkdir todos-api
cd todos-api
git init
npm init -y
npm i mongoose express
touch .gitignore
Includes node_modules on .gitignore file

Instructions
Iteration 1 - Setting your folder structure
You will need:

app.js file -> To be our server, and have all the routes we need

config folder > db.connection.js -> With a function that handle with our mongo connection

models folder > Todo.js -> create an Schema instance and export our model Todo

Iteration 2 - Todo Schema
Create a Todo model . The schema should have the following fields:

title - Type String. It should be required.
completed - Type Bollean, should have default false
timestamps - use, timstamps config of mongoose
Iteration 3 - Api Routes
Ok, with the model created lets start to create our routes, for complete CRUD.

Method	Endpoint	Payload	Response	Action
GET	/todos	-	[todos]	Get All Todos form DB
POST	/todos	{"title":String, "completed": Bollean}	{todo}	Create New Todo
PUT	/todos/:id	{"title":String, "completed": Bollean}	{todo}	Update Existing Todo by Id
DELETE	/todos/:id	-	-	Deletes todo
Test every single route using postman or insomnia

Iteration 4 - Create Front-End React
Now use what we learn on module 2 to create a React UI that consumes our routes on Api.

This is a chalenge, you need to have your express server running in some port to be able to connect your react application using axios

Happy coding! ðŸ’™


Todos Api Part 2
